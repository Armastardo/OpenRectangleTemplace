<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>This template was created for the purpose of easing development of box-styled controllers (rectangles) that work with a GameCube console and Nintendo 64 via a USB C to console cable. It uses a RP2040 as its main controller so compatibility to other devices will be limited to the firmware you are using. (Such as <a href="https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/HayBox">HayBox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JulienBernard3383279/pico-rectangle">Pico-Rectangle</a>, etc). There&#39;s already a footprint added for a compatible USB-C port that will allow you to used said cables, as well as a USB C to C cable, or C to A cable for PC or Switch.</p>
<p>Labels are already assigned to the default pinout of the most popular firmware available as well as in stock parts for every component from LCSC. I recommend using the Fabrication Toolkit plugin that can be installed through KiCad's PCM.</p>
